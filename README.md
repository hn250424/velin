## Note

This is still a beta version.  
  
- The file tree system has not been sufficiently tested.  
- Auto-saving is not implemented, so if the power goes out, your work may be lost.  
- The find/replace feature only works within the currently opened file, not across the entire file tree.  
- Only one theme and font available.  
- Opening a new directory will destroy the previous session.
- Runs only on Windows OS.
